**PrintLab 3D**
PrintLab 3D is an innovative web-based platform that serves as a digital bridge between creative ideas and physical products through 3D printing technology. This project facilitates a seamless workflow for consultation, ordering, and realizing 3D printed models.

This project was developed as a Final Project for the Technopreneurship course, with a primary focus on creating a technology-driven business model that integrates three fundamental disciplines: Informatics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Interior Design.

**Project Concept**
In the digital age, many brilliant ideas from designers, engineers, and creators are hindered by limited access to manufacturing equipment. PrintLab 3D emerges as a one-stop service solution that allows users to:
1. Consult directly with experts in real-time.
2. Upload their 3D designs for validation.
3. Order physical prints with a variety of material options.
3. Track the entire process until the final product is delivered.

Our vision is to democratize the custom manufacturing process, making it accessible, affordable, and collaborative.
